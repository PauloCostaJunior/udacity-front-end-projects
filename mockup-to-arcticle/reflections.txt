I've learned a lot about html structures(about parent to, children of and siblings more exaclty), relative path and some tags.
I already work with html, css, js and some other languages but it was still nice to see all of these things. I have to say that it was easy to solve this problem, i only had to search for one or another tag that i don't use frequently.
